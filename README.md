# find-the-duplicate-number-in-an-array
Find the Duplicate Number You are given an array arr containing n+1 integers, where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is exactly one duplicate number in the array, but it may appear more than once. Your task is to find the duplicate number without modifying the array and using constant extra space.
def findDuplicate(arr):
    slow = arr[0]
    fast = arr[0]
    while True:
        slow = arr[slow]
        fast = arr[arr[fast]]
        if slow == fast:
            break
    slow = arr[0]
    while slow != fast:
        slow = arr[slow]
        fast = arr[fast]
    return slow
arr = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
print(findDuplicate(arr))
